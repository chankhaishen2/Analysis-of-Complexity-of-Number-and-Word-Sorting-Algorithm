# Analysis of Complexity of Number and Word Sorting Algorithm (Radix Sort)
1. This repository contains the source code of analysis of complexity of number and word sorting algorithm (radix sort) which is part of the Assignment 1 for the Advanced Algorithms and Time Complexities subject.  
2. "Question1 (Number Sorting).py" contains the source code for the number sorting algorithm.
3. "Question2 (Word Sorting).py" contains the source code for the word sorting algorithm.
4. "Question3 (Complexity Analysis of Number Sorting).py" contains the source code for implementing the complexity analysis of the number sorting algorithm.
5. "Question3 (Complexity Analysis of Word Sorting).py" contains the source code for implementing the complexity analysis of the word sorting algorithm.

# Complexity Analysis by Experiment
1. The complexity analysis is done by adding primitive operation counters to the programme of the sorting algorithms. 
2. Experiments are carried out such that the fixed variable is the number of digits (number sorting) or the maximum number of characters (word sorting), the manipulated variable is the number of numbers (number sorting) or the number of words (word sorting) and the observed variable is the number of primitive operations.
3. The experiment results are plotted into graphs. "Graph of Number of Primitive Operations vs N for Number Sorting Algorithm.png" and "Graph of Number of Primitive Operations vs N for Word Sorting Algorithm.png" are the experiment result for the number sorting algorithm and the word sorting algorithm respectively.

# User Note
1. Open this folder using PyCharm.
2. Open either "Question1 (Number Sorting).py", "Question2 (Word Sorting).py", "Question3 (Complexity Analysis of Number Sorting).py" or "Question3 (Complexity Analysis of Word Sorting).py".
3. Before clicking the "run" button in the top right corner of PyCharm to run the file, make sure "current file" is selected instead of "main".
